# Sensitivity Analysis Evolutionary Algorithms

The Sensitivity Analysis of Evolutinary Algorithms code reposiotry provides an comprehesive framework to study the influence of EAs hyper-paramters. This code reposetory builds on two senstivity analysis measures: elementry effect and varrience based effect.

## Evolutionary Algorithms Studied
- Single Objective Algorithms (SA_SOO folder)
    - Diffrential Evolution (DE)
    - Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)
- Multi-Ojective Algorithms (SA_MOO folder)
    - Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III)
    - Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D)
