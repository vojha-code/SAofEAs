# Sensitivity Analysis Evolutionary Algorithms

The Sensitivity Analysis of Evolutinary Algorithms code reposiotry provides an comprehesive framework to study the influence of EAs hyper-paramters. This code reposetory builds on two senstivity analysis measures: elementry effect and varrience based effect.
